This PHP script knocks out two things, it builds the website and it pulls out all of the PDF data.
A few other important points that I ran into with building this, the scope of this file and where
the pdf's are is important. Second, this is built for adding more PDF's, it will show everything inside
the database and aslong as its in there, it will show on the website. Third, for the keyword look up,
this was the last thing I worked on, and I believe it is very close to being finished and working, but
for the life of me, I just can't get it working.
